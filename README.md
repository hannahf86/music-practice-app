## Aim of the app
The Music Practice Journal is a mobile app that allows music teachers and students to monitor and organise their music practice.

## Problem
Traditionally, music teachers would write down the practice notes in a paper notebook, but research has shown students rarely engage in their notes in this form.

My instincts told me that if the notes were in digital form, they would be more likely to be viewed. I conducted brief interviews with students and music teachers to gain their insight into whether this would be a useful product to invest in, and whether or not they thought it would improve their overall music learning experience.

The results indicated this was indeed the case, and so I set about designing the app.

## Goal
To create an app that would allow music teachers to set weekly practice routines for their students, whilst maintaining customisation and flexibility without placing restrictions that would have implications on how the teacher conducts their lesson.

## Pain Points
- **Students must remember to pack/unpack quite a few books**
It was highlighted that music books are often at the bottom of the priority list when it came to packing their things. With so many lessons in a day, students are required to carry a lot of heavy books.

- **Their school homework is on an app**
Students at this particular school use the app called ‘Show My Homework’. Many students tie their homework in with their practice time so it would be easier if these bits of information were in the same place.

- **The process at home**
Many students leave their instruments set up ready to practice, so would often wander over to their instrument without taking the time to get their notebook out.
