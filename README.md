# Music Practice Journal
[Case Study](https://hannahbullickdesigns.wordpress.com/music-practice-journal/)

## Aim of the app
The Music Practice Journal is a mobile app that allows music teachers and students to monitor and organise their music practice.

## The Problem
Traditionally, music teachers would write down the practice notes in a paper notebook, but research has shown students rarely engage in their notes in this form.
My instincts told me that if the notes were in digital form, they would be more likely to be viewed. I conducted brief interviews with students and music teachers to gain their insight into whether this would be a useful product to invest in, and whether or not they thought it would improve their overall music learning experience.
The results indicated this was indeed the case, and so I set about designing the app.
